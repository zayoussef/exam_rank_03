# ft_printf Project

## Overview
The `ft_printf` project is a custom implementation of the standard C library function `printf`. This project focuses on handling specific format specifiers: `%x`, `%s`, and `%d`.

## Features
- **Hexadecimal (%x)**: Converts an integer to a hexadecimal string.
- **String (%s)**: Prints a string.
- **Decimal (%d)**: Prints a decimal (integer) number.

## How to Test
You can test the functionality of this project using the command line. Below is an example of how to create a test file and use it:

```sh
# Create a test file with a specific number of lines
yes "This is a test string" | head -n 10 > test_file.txt

# Run your program (replace `your_program` with the actual executable or script name)
./your_program test_file.txt
```

## Usage
1. Compile the project using `make` or your preferred compiler.
2. Run the executable with the desired format string and arguments.

## Example
```sh
# Assuming your executable is named `ft_printf`
./ft_printf "Hex: %x, String: %s, Decimal: %d\n" 255 "Hello, World!" 42
```

## Compilation
To compile the project, you can use the provided `Makefile`:
```sh
make
```
