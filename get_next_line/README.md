# Get Next Line Project

## Overview
This project is designed to read a line from a file descriptor. It is a common utility in many programming tasks where reading input line-by-line is required.

## Features
- Efficiently reads lines from a file.
- Handles different file descriptors.
- Manages memory effectively to avoid leaks.

## How to Test
You can test the functionality of this project using the command line. Below is an example of how to create a test file and use it:

```sh
# Create a test file with a specific number of lines
yes "This is a test string" | head -n 10 > test_file.txt

# Run your program (replace `your_program` with the actual executable or script name)
./your_program test_file.txt
```

## Usage
1. Compile the project (if necessary).
2. Run the executable with the file you want to read as an argument.

## Example
```sh
# Assuming your executable is named `get_next_line`
./get_next_line test_file.txt
```

## Decoration
To make your README more visually appealing, you can add some decorations like badges, images, or even a table of contents.
